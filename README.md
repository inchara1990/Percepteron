# Perceptron 
The perceptron algorithm is an online learning, where the weight vector is penalized based on the classification of the last instance. 
The final weight vector is nothing but the weighted sum of all misclassified instances. The decision boundary is updated- made more
positive or more negative based on whether the mistake is made on a positive example or a negative example.
